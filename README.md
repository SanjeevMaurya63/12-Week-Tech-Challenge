# 🚀 12-Week Tech Challenge

Welcome to my public **12-Week Tech Mastery Challenge**!  
From July to September, I’m focusing on mastering the foundations of:

## 🔷 Domains I'm Covering:
- **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** using Python  
- **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, Projects)  
- **Machine Learning** (Pandas, NumPy, ML Models)  
- **Python** for scripting & backend (Flask planned later)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `MachineLearning/Pandas` → All notebooks from Krish Naik Pandas series  
- `WebDevelopment` → HTML/CSS practice & mini-projects (e.g., Food landing page)

---

## ✅ Week-wise Progress
Check my weekly progress posts on LinkedIn!  
- **Week 1**: Pandas, Web page, DSA Basics (TC/SC, Palindrome, Armstrong, Factors)

## 📌 Goal
> Stay consistent for 12 weeks, build 3+ real projects, and share everything in public 💪
